// it will return 1, when ever we use + unary operator with a data type it tries to convert it into number
console.log(+true);
// it will return false, because negation operator always tries to convert the value into a boolean, !true would return false and viceversa so first convert the value into boolean and then applies not to it.
console.log(!"JavaScript");
